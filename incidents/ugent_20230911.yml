  <p>
     A total lockup of the GPFS shared filesystems has occurred around 02:20 last night.
  </p>

  <p>
     Cluster workernodes are currently unable to start new jobs, we are looking into fixing the problem ASAP.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Update 09:39:</strong><br/>
  To mitigate the problems we are seeing, we need to perform some emergency maintenance updates
  to the Infiniband switches that are using for the shared filesystems.
  </p>
  <p>
  This means that HPC-UGent shared filesystems will be unavailable on the HPC-UGent Tier-2 login nodes as well,
  and that for UGent VSC accounts (<code>vsc4****</code>) both <code>$VSC_HOME</code> and <code>$VSC_DATA</code> will be unavailable on Tier-1 Hortense, until further notice.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Update 13:05</strong><br/>
  Firmware update for Infiniband switches + subsequent reboot of IB switches are almost complete.<br/>
  We do not expect any data loss or corruption problems on the HPC-UGent filesystems because of this event.
  </p>
