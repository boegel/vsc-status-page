  title: HPC-UGent shared filesystems unstable ($VSC_HOME, $VSC_DATA, $VSC_SCRATCH*)

  <p>
     A total lockup of the GPFS shared filesystems has occurred around Mon 11 Sept'23 at 02:20.
  </p>

  <p>
     Cluster workernodes are currently unable to start new jobs, we are looking into fixing the problem ASAP.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Update Mon 11 Sept'23 - 09:39:</strong><br/>
  To mitigate the problems we are seeing, we need to perform some emergency maintenance updates
  to the Infiniband switches that are using for the shared filesystems.
  </p>
  <p>
  This means that HPC-UGent shared filesystems will be unavailable on the HPC-UGent Tier-2 login nodes as well,
  and that for UGent VSC accounts (<code>vsc4****</code>) both <code>$VSC_HOME</code> and <code>$VSC_DATA</code> will be unavailable on Tier-1 Hortense, until further notice.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Update Mon 11 Sept'23 - 13:05</strong><br/>
  Firmware update for Infiniband switches + subsequent reboot of IB switches are almost complete.<br/>
  We do not expect any data loss or corruption problems on the HPC-UGent filesystems because of this event.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Update Mon 11 Sept'23 - 14:54</strong>
  Problems have been resolved, we are running some test jobs to make sure the HPC-UGent shared filesystems are stable again
  on all HPC-UGent Tier-2 clusters.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Update Mon 11 Sept'23 - 15:57</strong>
  $VSC_HOME and $VSC_DATA is available again on Tier-1 Hortense for UGent VSC accounts (<code>vsc4****</code>).
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Update Mon 11 Sept'23 - 16:57</strong>
  Test jobs have not revealed any problems, so HPC-UGent shared filesystems can be considered stable again.<br/>
  Job schedulers will gradually be resumed on all HPC-UGent Tier-2 clusters in the next couple of hours.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Update Mon 11 Sept'23 - 22:56</strong>
  Problems with the HPC-UGent shared filesystems have resurfaced.
  The HPC-UGent $VSC_HOME, $VSC_DATA, and $VSC_SCRATCH* filesystems are currently unavailable everywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Update Tue 12 Sept'23 - 00:10</strong>
  HPC-UGent shared filesystems are available again on the HPC-UGent Tier-2 login nodes and VSC Tier-1 Hortense,
  but stability can not be guaranteed.<br/>
  Job schedulers on all HPC-UGent Tier-2 clusters have been paused so we can investigate further.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Update Tue 12 Sept'23 - 07:53</strong>
  The cause of the problems with the HPC-UGent shared filesystems is a core Infiniband switch that is acting up,
  and spontaneously rebooted on Mon 11 Septâ€™23 around 22:37 CEST (and again on Tue 12 Sept'12 around 05:25 CEST).<br/>
  We are looking into resolving the issue ASAP and making the HPC-UGent filesystems stable again.
  </p>
  <strong>Update Tue 12 Sept'23 - 13:56</strong>
  We are still seeing stability problems with the Infiniband network that is used for the HPC-UGent shared filesystems.<br/>
  We are in touch with the vendor of the hardware, and are doing what we can to resolve the problem ASAP.
  </p>
