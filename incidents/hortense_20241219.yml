  <p>
  Maintenance is scheduled for Monday 24 (08:00 CET) till Friday 28 February 2025 at the HPC-UGent site.
  This will affect the Tier1 Compute infrastructure Hortense.
  </p>
  <p>
  Tier1 Compute Hortense will be unavailable during this period.
  This includes workernodes as well as login and debug nodes, and the dedicated Tier1 scratch filesystem.
  </p>
  <p>
  It has become apparant that network connectivity to/from Tier1 Compute Hortense will be severely disrupted during the maintenance.
  This will make it impossible for jobs to run.
  </p>
  <p>
  Update on 28 February 2025:
  All Tier1 partitions are back online and have already been running jobs for several hours.
  Tier1 login nodes and storage are also available again.
  </p>
  <p>
