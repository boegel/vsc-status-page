  <p>Due to an issue with the cooling, we have to shut down half of the Milan nodes of Tier1.</p>
  <p>The dedicated cooling infrastructure for Tier-1 is currently not coping well with the load of phase1 + phase2.</p>
  <p>To protect the integrity of all Tier-1 infrastructure, we are shutting down part of the Milan nodes of phase2.</p>
  <p>Stability of the cooling system is closely being monitored.</p>
  <p>In communication with our vendor, we are looking for a solution.</p>
