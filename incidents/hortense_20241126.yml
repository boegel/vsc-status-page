  <p>
    Tier1c will get kernel and Infiniband updates, and all
    nodes will be rebooted. This will be done per partition
    and rolling, meaning nodes will update as soon as they are
    empty and become available again asap. This starts Tuesday
    26 November, with the cpu_rome partition. Following the
    cpu_milan partition, then finally the gpu partitions.
    The intervention will take maximum 3 times 3 days.

    Currently running updates: cpu_milan
    Finished running updates: cpu_rome_all
