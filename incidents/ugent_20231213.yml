  <p>
  SSH access to the UGent Tier-2 login nodes was briefly not possible.
  This was due to a problem with a service on one of the login nodes.
  Access to the web portal was unaffected.
  </p>
  <p>
  10:40 The problematic service on the login nodes was restarted, resolving the issue.
  But this has caused a disruption of all open SSH connections to the login nodes.
