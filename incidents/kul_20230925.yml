  Tier-2 Genius maintenance downtime
  
  We are migrating the OS of Geniu- from CentOS 7 to Rocky 8. Tier-2 cluster wICE will remain operational during this migration.
  Have a look at the documentation page for a full overview: https://docs.vscentrum.be/leuven/genius_2_rocky.html

  update 25/09 : During the migration, also all login nodes will be migrated. This might result in broken connections. You can however re-login and you will be routed to an active login node.
