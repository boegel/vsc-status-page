  <p><strong>Update Mon 6 May 2024 - 15:00</strong><br/> The scratch filesystem is back up and available on all nodes again.</p>

  <p><strong>Update Fri 3 May 2024 - 17:00</strong><br/> On Friday 3 May, we have restarted our login nodes, so that users can login again.</p>
  
  <p>The user and data filesystems are also available again. We are still experiencing severe issues with bringing up the scratch filesystem, so that remains unavailable until further notice.</p>

  <p>Users can submit jobs again, but only using the data filesystem.</p>

  <p><strong>Update Thu 2 May 2024 - 17:20</strong><br/> The user and data filesystems are up and running, and are available on other VSC sites. We are still experiencing issues bringing up the scratch filesystem.</p>

  <p><strong>Original message:</strong><br/>
  Due to a problem with the cooling infrastructure, we had to shutdown the infrastructure.
  The storage system was also shut down.</p>

  <p>All running jobs are lost. Our apologies.</p>

  <p>No access to CalcUA or other VSC clusters is possible at the moment.
  Weâ€™ll keep you informed.</p>

  <p>Our apologies for the inconvenience.</p>
