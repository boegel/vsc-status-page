  The "swalot" HPC-UGent Tier-2 cluster will be shut down end of October 2023, to make room for a new cluster.
  </p>
  <p>
  Only jobs that are guaranteed to finish by Mon 30 Oct 08:00 CET will still start.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>If you are still relying on swalot, please migrate your workloads to another cluster ASAP.</strong>
