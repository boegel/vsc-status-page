  Maintenance to the HPC-UGent network infrastructure is scheduled from Monday 13 May (08:00 CEST) till Friday 17 May 2024.
  A major cleanup, refactoring, and renewal of the core networks (both regular Ethernet and InfiniBand high-speed interconnect) and some core services will be done.

  All HPC-UGent Tier2 infrastructure, including all workernodes as well as login and debug nodes, and the Tier2 shared storage (home, data, scratch) will be unavailable during this period.

  Update 17/05/2024:
  The majority of Tier2 clusters and nodes is now back online and accepting and running jobs.
  Several have effectively been running (previously queued) jobs since yesterday.
  Since this morning, we have opened up the Tier2 login nodes, debug nodes and webportal.

  During this maintenance window, a major overhaul of the network infrastructure was done, necessitating an actual complete downtime of all infrastructure.
  Networking hardware and cables were replaced, rewired and updated.
  In addition, firmware updates were done.
  Ensuing configuration, extensive tests were conducted before releasing the clusters.
