  <p>
  We have uncovered an instability issue on the infrastructure supporting the login nodes, debug nodes, webportal and Globus.
  On unpredictable moments, this issue might cause a node or service to hang, forcing us to restart it.
  This issue does not affect your jobs.
  We are further investigating the issue in search for a fix.

  But for the time being, please report to compute@vscentrum.be when you notice a login node, debug node, webportal or Globus is unavailable to you.
