  <p>
  On 2025-01-01, a problem with the Lustre file system appeared. The distributed lock manager puts a very high load on some Lustre servers, resulting in frequent timeouts. Users will experience this as slow or impossible access to $VSC_SCRATCH and staging directories. Since the cause of the problem has not yet been identified, a reliable time to solution cannot be provided at the moment. Workloads that do not make use of the Lustre file system should not be affected.
