  <p>
  The oldest part of Genius is operational since 6 years. We will be shutting down the nodes in enclosures r22i13 and  r23i13.
  We will repurpose some of the nodes for an interactive partition in Genius. The other nodes will be kept in the racks and can for a limited time be re-used for specific purposes. 
  Genius large memory nodes and the GPU nodes with the nVidia P100 will remain operational, in an unsupported state, also the Cascadelake nodes will remain available.
  And with wICE Icelake and SaphireRapids, there is a large amount of compute power available, so we expect turning of those nodes will have minimal impact.
