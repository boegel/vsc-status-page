  <p>
  The Openstack API for the VSC Tier-1 Cloud infrastructure is temporarily down.
  The dashboard is still available.

  <p>
  Likely cause is (again) an issue with an upgrade script from RedHat.
  We are in communication with RedHat to get this issue fixed as soon as possible.

  Update 04/04/2025 10h10: the issue is resolved. Tier-1 Cloud APIs are again available.
