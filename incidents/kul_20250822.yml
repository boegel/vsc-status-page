  <p>The problem is been investigated. We've put a system wide reservation on the cluster.</p>
  <p>Running jobs should not be affected.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>update 23/08/2025 9:00h</b> Lustre metadata performance is back to normal. Both Genius and wICE are open again.</li>
    <li><b>update 22/08/2025</b> Lustre metadata performance is unstable, which makes some prolog checks fail and hence stops a job at startup. 
    A disk rebuild has completed, but the situation is not yet resolved. 
    Running jobs should continue normally, but we keep the system closed for further investigation.</li>
    </ul>
