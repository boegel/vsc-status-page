  <p>
     A cooling failure occured at UGent data center S10 around 22/07/2022 05:00, so we had to 
     stop the job scheduler. This means that no new jobs will start, but the running jobs are
     still running. 
  </p>
  <p>
     We do apologize for the inconvenience.
  </p>
  <p>
     The temperature in the data center normalized using the backup cooling system, we have
     restarted the scheduler. (New jobs sre scheduled to run.)
