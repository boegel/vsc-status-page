  <p>On Thursday 11 July 2024, a planned test of the UGent datacenter S10 Disaster Recovery Procedure (DRP) will take place.</p>

  <p>As a result, there will temporarily be <strong>no network access to all infrastructure hosted in UGent datacenter S10</strong>.</p>

  <p>This includes Tier-1 login nodes + web portal, HPC-UGent Tier-2 login nodes + web portal, Tier-1 Cloud interface + network access to VMs,
  as well as the VSC accountpage <https://account.vscentrum.be>).</p>

  <p>It should <em>not</em> affect running jobs and VMs, unless they require access to outside world (which will not work).<br/>
  Internal network + access to shared filesystems ($VSC_HOME, $VSC_DATA, $VSC_SCRATCH*) from jobs on the system will be unaffected.</p>
