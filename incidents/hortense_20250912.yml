  <p>
Access to Tier1 systems is shut down with immediate effect.
This is in response to a major security flaw in the kernel, which has been recently identified.
  </p>
  <p>
Access limitation applies to:
<ul>
  <li> all Tier1 login nodes </li>
  <li> the Tier1 web portal tier1.hpc.ugent.be </li>
  <li> the Tier1 HPC storage systems </li>
</ul>
All these systems will not be reachable.
However, running jobs will not be affected.
  </p>

  <p>
In the next few days, we will perform emergency maintenance procedures.
If all goes well, the systems should be back up in the beginning of next week.
  </p>
