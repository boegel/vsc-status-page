  <p>
  Tier-2 wICE needs a full maintenance window. The ethernet switches will be updated and rebooted. This will temporarly break connections to the netapp (VSC_HOME, VSC_DATA en apps).
  In the same time window a slurm update will be applied. Jobs that can't end before January 3th 08:00 will remain in the queue. The system will be released as soon as possible after the update and appropriate tests have been run.
  During this maintenance, Genius will remain operational.
