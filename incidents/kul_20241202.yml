  <p>
  The Clusterstor metadata servers needed rebooting following a disk failure
  and the Lustre clients are only slowly recovering from this event.

  Scratch and staging storage may be temporarily unavailable on the login
  and compute nodes of the KU Leuven Tier-2 clusters.

  Reservations have been put in place on Genius and wICE to prevent
  new jobs from starting.

  <ul>
    <li><b>update</b>: All servers and clients have now recovered and the reservations have been removed.</li>
  </ul>
