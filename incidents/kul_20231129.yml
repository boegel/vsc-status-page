    <li><b>update 01/12/2023</b>A preventive reservation has been set on the whole cluster tarting Monday morning. This is just in case we need a larger scale reboot of the file system, which is not yet sure. For now jobs that can't finish before Monday will be held in the queue untill the reservation is released. Jobs that are running will keep on running.</li>
     <li><b>update 01/12/2023</b> The reservation has been moved to Wednesday. No special errors are reported</li>
     <li><b>update 04/12/2023</b> The source of the problem is not yet clear, but there were no hardware errors reported. There will be no full reboot of the system needed, so the reservation will be released. We will keep on monitoring the system, performance might still be more variable. In order to check for undetected broken network links, the network will be further examined, while the system is under load.</li>
     <li><b>update 05/12/2023</b> The system appears to be stable since 10:30 yesterday, with three network switches disabled. The network throughput is currently one quarter of the normal capacity. From tomorrow morning, December 6th, we will reenable switches gradually, to see when the problems reappear so we can locate possible broken parts.</li>
      <li><b>update 18/12/2023</b> The system has been to be stable, only one network switches is disabled. The network throughput is normal.</li>
