  Problems with tier-2 scratch performance
  Users may experience low responsiveness of the scratch storage on Genius and wICE. The issue with the infiniband network is identified. To mitigate the probleit will probably include frequent reboots of a number of nodes including the login nodes.

update:
        A preventive reservation has been set on the whole cluster tarting Monday morning. This is just in case we need a larger scale reboot of the file system, which is not yet sure. For now jobs that can't finish before Monday will be held in the queue untill the reservation is released. Jobs that are running will keep on running.
