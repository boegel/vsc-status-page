  <p><strong>Update Mon 26 June 2023 - 10:00</strong><br/>The storage infrastructure and compute nodes are accessible again.</p>
  <p>We are still experiencing some issues with the Leibniz login nodes, so please log in via the Hopper (<emph>login-hopper.hpc.uantwerpen.be</emph>) or Vaughan login nodes (<emph>login-vaughan.hpc.uantwerpen.be</emph>).</p>

  <p><strong>Original message:</strong><br/>An unscheduled power interruption caused our infrastructure to go down.</p>

  <p>At the moment of writing, no systems are accessible, including our storage infrastructure. This means that access to other VSC sites (both Tier-2 and Tier-1) is not possible.</p>

  <p>Our apologies for the inconvenience.</p>
