  <p>There are authentication issues when logging in to the KU Leuven Tier-2 clusters, ssh access is currently not possible.</p>
  <p>A limited number of applications is still accessible via the <a href="https://ondemand.hpc.kuleuven.be/pun/sys/dashboard">OnDemand portal</a>.</p>
  <p>As a temporary workaround to open a terminal on the cluster, the "Interactive Shell" app can be used on the OnDemand portal (note that the wice interactive partition is currently not usable).</p>

    <li><b>update 14/07/2025</b> login nodes are gradually available again. You should be able to login to the cluster in the regular way.</li>
  </ul>
