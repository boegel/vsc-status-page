  <p>
  Belnet needs to do an emergency change on the router of the VSC-BELNET connection. During the maintance periode the router will be unavailable for 15 minutes.
  This means that VSC_HOME and VSC_DATA directories that are mounted cross-site will be unavailable at that moment. Als transfers to Tier-1 Data might be interupted.
