  <p>We have scheduled a downtime for all CalcUA clusters between Tuesday July 2, 7 am, and Friday July 5, 6 pm.</p>
  
  <p>This is needed to finalize changes to our storage system (firmware updates), as a follow-up measure 
  for the emergency shutdown from May 1.</br>
  We will also evaluate our emergency (disaster recovery) procedures and add extra detection systems.</br>
  Furthermore, we will also perform some other maintenance tasks.</br>
  And finally, we will run some tests before we release the clusters again.</p>

  <p>During the first phase (firmware updates + emergency procedures), our filesystems will not be available.</br>
  This implies that access to other VSC Tier-2 clusters will not be possible.</p>

  <p>Access to VSC Tier-1 is possible, but you will not have access to your $VSC_HOME and $VSC_DATA directories.</br>
  We estimate that this first phase will not take more than 2 days.</p>

  <p>During the second phase, the filesystems will be available again, and as such
  access to other VSC Tier-2 clusters should be possible again.</br>
  But during the maintenance tasks, it will not be possible to submit and run jobs on our CalcUA clusters.</p>

  <p>We will let you know when the filesystems are online again and when you can again submit jobs to the CalcUA clusters.</p>

  <p>Our apologies for the inconvenience.</p>
