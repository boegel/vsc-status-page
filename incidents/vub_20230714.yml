  On Friday 14th July at around 11:30 (CEST), the main VUB campus suffered a
  generalised network outage affecting the datacenter hosting the Tier-2 HPC
  cluster Hydra. The main issues regarding the functioning of the cluster are:

  * loss of access to the login nodes of Hydra

  * many running jobs in Hydra will be severely impacted due to the loss of
  connection of the cluster with the storage serving the home and data
  directories of the users

  The network outage at VUB campus is still ongoing. We will keep this incident
  up to date with any new information.

  **update: 14-07-2023 16:30**

  The network outage in VUB main campus is resolved. Access to both the
  Hydra HPC cluster and the Pixiu object storage has been reestablished.

  The job scheduler of Hydra is back online and jobs in the queue are being
  processed as usual. Jobs already running before the outage might have failed
  due to the disconnect of the VSC_HOME and VSC_DATA storage, users that had
  running jobs should check the output for errors and re-submit any failed
  jobs. Jobs that failed to start during the outage have been re-queued
  automatically. Jobs of non-VUB users in Hydra will be held in queue until
  Monday, July 17th.
