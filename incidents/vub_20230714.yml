  On Friday 14th July at around 11 AM, the main VUB campus suffered a
  generalised network outage affecting the datacenter hosting the Tier-2 HPC
  cluster Hydra. The main issues regarding the functioning of the cluster are:

      * loss of access to the login nodes of Hydra

      * many running jobs in Hydra will be severely impacted due to the loss of
      connection of the cluster with the storage serving the home and data
      directories of the users

  The network outage at VUB campus is still ongoing. We will keep this incident
  up to date with any new information.
