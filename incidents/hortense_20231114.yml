  <p>
  Starting Monday 27 November 2023, we will upgrade the operating system of Tier1 Hortense to Redhat Enterprise Linux 8.8
  This is primarily to maintain security and integrity of the system.
  We donâ€™t expect this upgrade to have an impact on the scientific software or the way in which you run jobs.
  </p>
  <p>
  We need to eventually bring down all nodes to execute this upgrade but to limit the impact on you, we will execute these upgrades per partition.
  We will start with the partition cpu_rome. By 27 November 9h00, we will drain all the nodes of this partition. 
  Nodes will then become available again as soon as they have been updated.
  Only once upgrade work on this entire partition is finished, will we switch to the next partition (bringing that down, etc.)
  </p>
