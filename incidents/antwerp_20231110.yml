  <p><strong>Update Mon 27 November 2023 - 15:00</strong><br/>The login nodes are accessible and jobs can be submitted, but we are still running some final benchmark tests. The reservation will end at 6 pm, and jobs that were put on held state will be restarted first.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your understanding and patience!</p>

  <p><strong>Update Mon 20 November 2023 - 17:00</strong><br/>We are still busy with the upgrade of our scratch storage filesystem.<br />
  Therefore, we unfortunately need to extend our downtime. We will keep you informed about the availability.</p>

  <p>Our apologies for the inconvenience.</p>

  <p><strong>Original message:</strong><br />We have scheduled a downtime for all CalcUA clusters between Thursday November 16, 8 am, and Monday November 20, 6 pm.

  <p>This is needed for planned work on the high-voltage network on CGB on Saturday.<br/>
  Therefore, we need to power down all our equipment, clusters as well as storage.<br/>
  We have decided to combine this downtime with other maintenance tasks (that would otherwise require yet another downtime).<br/>
  Afterwards, we will run some tests before we release the clusters again.</p>

  <p>During the downtime, access to other VSC Tier-2 sites will not be possible. Access to VSC Tier-1 is possible but the shared filesystems $VSC_HOME and $VSC_DATA will not be available.</p>

  <p>Our apologies for the inconvenience.</p>
