  Due to unexpected impact of maintenance on the cooling infrastructure,
  all workernodes of Tier-1 Hortense are currently unavailable.

  The shared scratch filesystem (incl. home directories for Tier-1 Hortense) was unavailable from 15:10 to 16:40 CEST.

  We are looking into mitigating the problems ASAP.
