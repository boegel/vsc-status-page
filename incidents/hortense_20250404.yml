  <p>
  Vendors ATOS (now Eviden) and APAC will replace the direct cooling systems going to all processing units.
  This is to counteract a design issue with the cooling system, which has led a.o. to unavailabilities and broken hardware.
  If all goes well, broken hardware (including a large portion of the GPU nodes in the gpu_rome_a100_40 partition) will also be replaced.
  </p>
  <p>
  A complete downtime is scheduled starting Monday 5 May (08:00 CET) till Friday 16 May 2025.
  Tier1 Compute Hortense will be unavailable during this period.
  This includes workernodes as well as login and debug nodes, and the dedicated Tier1 scratch filesystem.
  </p>
  <p>
  We understand that this downtime is long and inconvenient, especially with the academic Tier1 projects cutoff of 2 June looming.
  But there is no alternative. This action needs to happen in order to prevent further damage to the system and to get hardware repaired.
  </p>
  <p>
  We actually hope the downtime can be contained to 2 weeks.
  We aim to limit the effective downtime as much as possible.
  Please take this downtime into account when planning your computational work.
