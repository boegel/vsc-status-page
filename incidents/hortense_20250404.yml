  title: Extensive maintenance to Tier1 infrastructure
  start_date: 2025-05-05 08:00:00

  <p>
  Vendors ATOS (now Eviden) and APAC will replace the direct cooling systems going to all processing units.
  This is to counteract a design issue with the cooling system, which has led a.o. to unavailabilities and broken hardware.
  If all goes well, broken hardware (including a large portion of the GPU nodes in the gpu_rome_a100_40 partition) will also be replaced.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>A complete downtime is scheduled starting Monday 5 May (08:00 CET) till Friday 16 May 2025.</strong>
  Tier1 Compute Hortense will be unavailable during this period.
  This includes workernodes as well as login and debug nodes, and the dedicated Tier1 scratch filesystem.
  </p>
  <p>
  We understand that this downtime is long and inconvenient, especially with the academic Tier1 projects cutoff of 2 June looming.
  But there is no alternative. This action needs to happen in order to prevent further damage to the system and to get hardware repaired.
  </p>
  <p>
  We actually hope the downtime can be contained to 2 weeks.
  We aim to limit the effective downtime as much as possible.
  Please take this downtime into account when planning your computational work.
  </p>
  <p>
  We will make use of the downtime to initiate the gradual migration towards RHEL9 for the Milan partition.<br/>
  128 nodes (out of 384) of the Milan partition will already be switched to RHEL9 when the system comes back up again.
  The size of the <code>cpu_milan_rhel9</code> partition will grow accordingly.
  Over the next few months, gradually more nodes will be migrated.<br/>
  Please make sure that your software/workflow is RHEL9 compliant (this is also a hard requirement for academic project applications at the next Tier1 cutoff).
  </p>

  Update 14/05/2025 14h00<br/>
  Extensive scheduled maintenance has been largely completed, and access to the system has been restored.
  Changes applied:
  The direct cooling infrastructure of Tier-1 Hortense got a thorough revision to counteract a design issue
  Some additional changes to the system, mainly related to the migration to the RHEL9 operating system (see https://docs.vscentrum.be/gent/tier1_hortense.html#migration-to-rhel9-operating-system)
  Majority of system is ready for production workloads, but some nodes still need further maintenance
