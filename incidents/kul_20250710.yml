  <p>All login nodes and much of the compute nodes of wICE and Genius are in trouble due to NetApp storage issues.</p>
  <p>One of the consequences was that it was not possible to login to the clusters as the connection attempts were hanging. This problem has since been resolved.</p>
  <p>Slurm was also unavailable which meant it was not possible to e.g. submit jobs. Also this has since been resolved.</p>
