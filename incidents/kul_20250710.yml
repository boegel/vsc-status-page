  <p>All login nodes and much of the compute nodes of wICE and Genius were in trouble due to NetApp storage issues.</p>
  <p>One of the consequences was that it was not possible to login to the clusters as the connection attempts were hanging. This problem has since been resolved.</p>
  <p>Slurm was also unavailable which meant it was not possible to e.g. submit jobs. Also this has since been resolved.</p>
  <p>If you had any jobs in a running state during this outage, consider verifying that the calculations are not hanging or crashing. In case any of your jobs experienced problems, please send the corresponding JobIDs to hpcinfo@kuleuven.be so that the spent compute credits can be refunded.</p>
