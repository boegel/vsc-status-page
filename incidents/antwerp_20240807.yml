  <p>On Thursday, August 8th, Digipolis will work on a fiber panel on which our dedicated VSC link is connected.<br/>
  As such, our dedicated VSC connection will most likely be interrupted from 8 am until somewhere in the late afternoon.</p>

  <p>During this period, the antwerpen shared filesystems (/{user,data,apps}/antwerpen) will not be available.<br/>
  This implies that no jobs from antwerpen users can run nor start on non-antwerpen Tier-2 clusters, and access to these Tier-2 clusters will not be possible either.<br/>
  Jobs running on the Tier-1 cluster Hortense should not be impacted (as long as they do not use anything from our shared filesystems).</p>

  <p>We will let you know when the work is finished and when our shared filesystems are available again (and login is possible again).</p>
 
  <p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
