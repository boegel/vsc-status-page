  The login nodes of VUB's Tier-2 cluster Hydra will be rebooted today
  (July 26th, 2023) at 22:00 CEST.

  The reboot of the login nodes of Hydra is necessary to fix connection issues
  with the data storage of other VSC sites, which serve the $VSC_HOME and
  $VSC_DATA of non-VUB users in the cluster.

  The two login nodes will be rebooted one by one with ~15 minutes in between,
  ensuring that Hydra will remain available during the operation. Computational
  jobs in the cluster will not be affected by the reboot.
