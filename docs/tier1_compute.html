<p> Maintenance is scheduled for Monday 24 (08:00 CET) till Friday 28 February 2025 at the HPC-UGent site. This will affect the Tier1 Compute infrastructure Hortense. </p>
<p> Tier1 Compute Hortense will be unavailable during this period. This includes workernodes as well as login and debug nodes, and the dedicated Tier1 scratch filesystem. </p>
<p> It has become apparant that network connectivity to/from Tier1 Compute Hortense will be severely disrupted during the maintenance. This will make it impossible for jobs to run. </p>
<p> Update on 28 February 2025: All Tier1 partitions are back online and have already been running jobs for several hours. Tier1 login nodes and storage are also available again. </p>
<p> Please be aware of the following changes: <ul> <li>All planned network changes have been successfully completed.</li> <li>IP address changes have been implemented, as a result of major network refactoring.</li> See <a href="https://docs.hpc.ugent.be/troubleshooting/#issues-reaching-servers-from-hpc-infrastructure">https://docs.hpc.ugent.be/troubleshooting/#issues-reaching-servers-from-hpc-infrastructure</a> for more details. <li>Default locations used by R for self-installed R packages have been changed (see <a href="https://docs.hpc.ugent.be/r-packages">https://docs.hpc.ugent.be/r-packages</a>).</li> <li>Linux kernels have been updated on Tier1 login and worker nodes.</li> </ul> </p>

<p> Considerable hardware is currently broken in the Tier1 Compute infrastructure Hortense. Site research has shown this is due to corrosion and leakage in the cooling system directly going to the processing units. Vendors ATOS (now Eviden) and APAC are aware of this issue and confirm this is due to a design issue with the cooling system. </p>
<p> The damage is extensive. A.o. 90% of all GPU nodes of the gpu_rome_a100_40 partition are unavailable. </p>
<p> We are in communication with vendors Eviden (previously ATOS) and APAC to have this damage fixed and hardware replaced as soon as possible. It is already clear that a complete retrofit of the cooling system will need to happen. This, no doubt, will require another substantial maintenance window. </p>
<p> We will inform all Tier1 users by mail as soon as a date is confirmed by vendor ATOS to execute these repairs. </p>
