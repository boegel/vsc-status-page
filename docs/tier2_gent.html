<p>
   A total lockup of the GPFS shared filesystems has occurred around Mon 11 Sept'23 at 02:20.
</p>
<p>
   Cluster workernodes are currently unable to start new jobs, we are looking into fixing the problem ASAP.
</p>
<p> <strong>Update Mon 11 Sept'23 - 09:39:</strong><br/> To mitigate the problems we are seeing, we need to perform some emergency maintenance updates to the Infiniband switches that are using for the shared filesystems. </p>
<p> This means that HPC-UGent shared filesystems will be unavailable on the HPC-UGent Tier-2 login nodes as well, and that for UGent VSC accounts (<code>vsc4****</code>) both <code>$VSC_HOME</code> and <code>$VSC_DATA</code> will be unavailable on Tier-1 Hortense, until further notice. </p>
<p> <strong>Update Mon 11 Sept'23 - 13:05</strong><br/> Firmware update for Infiniband switches + subsequent reboot of IB switches are almost complete.<br/> We do not expect any data loss or corruption problems on the HPC-UGent filesystems because of this event. </p>
<p> <strong>Update Mon 11 Sept'23 - 14:54</strong> Problems have been resolved, we are running some test jobs to make sure the HPC-UGent shared filesystems are stable again on all HPC-UGent Tier-2 clusters. </p>
<p> <strong>Update Mon 11 Sept'23 - 15:57</strong> $VSC_HOME and $VSC_DATA is available again on Tier-1 Hortense for UGent VSC accounts (<code>vsc4****</code>). </p>
<p> <strong>Update Mon 11 Sept'23 - 16:57</strong> Test jobs have not revealed any problems, so HPC-UGent shared filesystems can be considered stable again.<br/> Job schedulers will gradually be resumed on all HPC-UGent Tier-2 clusters in the next couple of hours. </p>
<p> <strong>Update Mon 11 Sept'23 - 22:56</strong> Problems with the HPC-UGent shared filesystems have resurfaced. The HPC-UGent $VSC_HOME, $VSC_DATA, and $VSC_SCRATCH* filesystems are currently unavailable everywhere. </p>
<p> <strong>Update Tue 12 Sept'23 - 00:10</strong> HPC-UGent shared filesystems are available again on the HPC-UGent Tier-2 login nodes and VSC Tier-1 Hortense, but stability can not be guaranteed.<br/> Job schedulers on all HPC-UGent Tier-2 clusters have been paused so we can investigate further. </p>
<p> <strong>Update Tue 12 Sept'23 - 07:53</strong> The cause of the problems with the HPC-UGent shared filesystems is a core Infiniband switch that is acting up, and spontaneously rebooted on Mon 11 Septâ€™23 around 22:37 CEST (and again on Tue 12 Sept'12 around 05:25 CEST).<br/> We are looking into resolving the issue ASAP and making the HPC-UGent filesystems stable again. </p>
<p> <strong>Update Tue 12 Sept'23 - 13:56</strong> We are still seeing stability problems with the Infiniband network that is used for the HPC-UGent shared filesystems.<br/> We are in touch with the vendor of the hardware, and are doing what we can to resolve the problem ASAP. </p>
<p> <strong>Update Tue 12 Sept'23 - 16:56</strong> Infiniband network has been restored (although with reduced redundancy), faulty switch has been removed.<br/> The HPC-UGent shared filesystems should be stable again.<br/> We are running tests for ensure that the clusters are stable again before we resume the HPC-UGent Tier-2 job schedulers. </p>
<p> <strong>Update Tue 12 Sept'23 - 19:41</strong> HPC-UGent Tier-2 job schedulers have been resumed, everything should be back to normal for now.<br/> We will follow up on the faulty Infiniband switch with the vendor, and will look into restoring redundancy in the Infiniband network later. </p>
